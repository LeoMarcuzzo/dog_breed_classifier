# Dog Breed Classifier
Dog breed classifier using CNN - Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree 

Implemented using PyTorch

The original repo (Udacity) can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-dog-classification)

The code is located in the Jupyter Notebook and the dataset can be found in the Udacity repo above


## Project Overview
Given an image of a dog, the application will estimate the canine's breed. If a human image is supplied, the application will try to identify the resembling dog breed.

CNN architectures tested:
- Pre-trained VGG16 network
- CNN developed from scratch (3 convolutional layers with MaxPool)

Test accuracy: 82% (VGG16)
